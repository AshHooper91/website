                freeCodeCamp is a free online system for learning how to code, starting with html
                and website technology moving on to more advanced topics. We have a study group in Bridgend,
                South Wales, United Kingdom, and this is a little website to help you learn more about us.
            </p>
            <h3>Is coding right for me?</h3>
            <p>We at freeCodeCamp Bridgend believe lifelong learning is important, as Albert Einstein said:
                <blockquote>The point is to understand. Tehre are only two ways to live your life: as though nothing is
                    a
                    miracle, or as though everything is a miracle.</blockquote>
                So why learn how to code? Well beyond being able to get your computer to do anything you want, make
                websites, make loads of friends from all walks of life!
                You will learn problem solving skills; how to break seemingly impossible problems into bightsize chunks
                and
                then tackle them.
                On the subject of our membership, we have members from professions such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Chef</li>
                    <li>Teacher</li>
                    <li>Office Manager</li>
                    <li>Student</li>
                    <li>Teenagers</li>
                    <li>Civil Engineer</li>
                    <li>And even a few professional software developers</li>
                </ul>
                In fact our biggest success story switched careers to become a Software Engineer after joining us. So
                as
                you can see we are for everyone regardless of prior knowledge,
                age, gender, profession. So what are you waiting for come to our next meeting and sign up online for <a
